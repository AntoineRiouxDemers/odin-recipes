        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
            <p>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C).<br>If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            <p>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.<br>If you have a pizza peel, you can transfer the dough onto it. Otherwise, use a piece of parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
            <p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges.<br>
                Place the mozzarella slices or shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
            <p>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven.<br>
                If using parchment paper, slide the pizza and parchment paper onto a baking sheet or pizza pan.<br>
                Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Garnish:</strong>
            <p>Once out of the oven, drizzle a bit of olive oil over the pizza. Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them on top.<br>Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <p>Slice your Margherita pizza into wedges and serve hot. Enjoy the classic simplicity of this delicious pizza!</p>
